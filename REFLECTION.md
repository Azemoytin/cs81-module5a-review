# Reflection

1. What I learned from reading and commenting on this code was how to better understand and explain what each function does in JavaScript, especially when using higher-order functions like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`. Commenting on the code helped me think more clearly about what each part of the function is doing and how everything works together.

2. The most confusing part was learning how to read each function and understand what it returns. At first, it was hard to tell whether a function returned a value, an array, or something else, especially with `.reduce()` and `.filter()`. But with practice and comments, it started to make more sense.
